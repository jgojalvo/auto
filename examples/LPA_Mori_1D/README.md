This is an example of applying the **local perturbation analysis (LPA)** to
a two-variable reaction-diffusion system that is known to give rise
to pattern formation.

This system was described and analyzed in
[this article](http://www.math.umn.edu/~ymori/docs/publications/wavepin.pdf).

The LPA was applied to this system in
[this article](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11538-012-9766-5).

A thorough discussion of the LPA can be found in
[this manuscript](http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1985).

An [IPython Notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw2.github.com/waltherg/auto/master/examples/LPA_Mori_1D/Mori_LPA_1D.ipynb?create=1) where I started digging around the different data structures created by AUTO.
