This is an example of applying the **local perturbation analysis (LPA)** to
a two-variable reaction-diffusion system that is known to give rise
to pattern formation.

This system was described and analyzed in
[this article](http://www.math.umn.edu/~ymori/docs/publications/wavepin.pdf).

The LPA was applied to this system in
[this article](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11538-012-9766-5).

A thorough discussion of the LPA can be found in
[this manuscript](http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1985).
